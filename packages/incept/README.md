# Incept JS

An Unopinionated Typed React Web Framework

## Why ?

 - Unopinionated. Design your own project structure.
 - Reusability. Develop plugins and deploy to npm.
 - Easy to Expert. Zero config to full customization.
 - No Tooling. React CSR & SSR out of the box.
 - Typescript First. Just import.

npm i --save inceptjs
```
